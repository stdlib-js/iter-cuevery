    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import iterCuEvery from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/iter-cuevery@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/iter-cuevery/tags). For example,

```javascript
import iterCuEvery from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/iter-cuevery@v0.1.1-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### iterCuEvery( iterator )

Returns an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] which cumulatively tests whether every iterated value is truthy.

```javascript
import array2iterator from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-to-iterator@esm/index.mjs';

var arr = array2iterator( [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1 ] );

var it = iterCuEvery( arr );
// returns <Object>

var v = it.next().value;
// returns true

v = it.next().value;
// returns true

v = it.next().value;
// returns true

v = it.next().value;
// returns false

v = it.next().value;
// returns false

var bool = it.next().done;
// returns true
```

The returned [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object has the following properties:

-   **next**: function which returns an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object containing the next iterated value (if one exists) assigned to a `value` property and a `done` property having a `boolean` value indicating whether the [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] is finished.
-   **return**: function which closes an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] and returns a single (optional) argument in an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object.
